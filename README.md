Rain Gardens Webpage
=========================

## Rain gardens synergistically benefit inhabitants, the natural flora, as well as animals in nearby bodies of water.
➢ They help inhabitants by reducing soil erosion, flooding, and returning moisture to the atmosphere.

➢ They help natural flora by amplifying seeding and cross pollination of natural flora.

➢ And they help animals in nearby bodies of water by reducing the amount of pollution reaching those bodies of water.

## Rain gardens, and similar solutions, are crucial to mitigating current negative effects on the environment.
➢ These negative effects are caused by increased industrialization, city infrastructure development, and population growth.

➢ More extreme weather due to climate change, i.e. flooding or drier soil, intensifies the need.

➢ As Chicago is one of the largest U.S. cities, rain gardens will positively affect many residents.

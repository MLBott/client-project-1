## Description
An information website on Rain Gardens. The target audience is elementary school children.
Why an informational website?

➢ Non-digital documents are often lost, yet most people carry phones throughout the day. A Pew Research Center poll found that last year 77% of Americans had smartphones.

➢ People using the rain gardens will want a setup process that is easy to understand.

➢ As busy people, the users will want an instructional process that’s easy to access whenever they require.

➢ To find the informational web site, they would only need to type in a web address or perform a Google search.

➢ Residents without phones can easily access the webpage at a local library or home computer.

➢ It’s a simple way to direct people to more information on the rain garden initiative.

➢ Since the rain garden initiative is primarily interested in assisting elder residents, website ease of use and simplicity will be a strong focus.
